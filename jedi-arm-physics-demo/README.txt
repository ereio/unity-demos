Project Description: In the Jedi project, I utilize three different scripts: HandController, ForceController, 
and ColorShifter. HandController handles the position of the hand in relation of the mouse. ForceController handles the force
on the blocks from the mouse's position. The ColorShifter shifts the color based on the OnMouseEnter and OnMouseExit function.
All together, it appears the hand is using the FORCE!
