Project Description: This project recreates a smaller version of the game Typing of the Dead. It works by manipulating a skeletons animations and
the processes and interactions between, before and after those animations as a makeshift FSM. Players can type to attack the skeleton and be
attacked by the skeleton if the user fails to input the words presented in time.
